# Curriculum Vitae

This is where cv text will go.

I'll probably use:

- the _Definition lists_ for **Basic info** 
- and _Multiple description terms and values_ for employment history.  


### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
